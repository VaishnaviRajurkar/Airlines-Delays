 An Airline Delay Dashboard is a data-driven tool designed to provide real-time visibility into the status of airline flights, 
 focusing on delays, cancellations, gate changes, and other critical flight-related information. It is primarily used by passengers,
 airline operators, airport staff, and even third-party developers to track flights' performance and manage operations. This dashboard aggregates
 data from multiple sources such as airlines, airports, weather systems, and government agencies, presenting it in an easy-to-read format.
